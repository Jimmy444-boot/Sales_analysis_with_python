The aim of this analysis is to find ways to maximise profit for the superstore by taking into the areas where the business could improve to promote profitability.


**Data Source **
A superstore is a very large supermarket, often selling household goods, clothes, and electrical goods, as well as food. Superstores typically charge anywhere from 15 to 45 per cent less than their smaller counterparts (Kaggle). The superstore data was collected from Kaggle. The data was downloaded in CSV format and uploaded to Google Collab for Pnadas  manipulation.
